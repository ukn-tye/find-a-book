# find-a-book
This is my module 21 assignment and this assignment was definetlly a struggle for me because I am not very great at doing backend code but I was able to complete this challenge and I was also able to help a couple class mates do the same. In this assignment I was expected to complete the task of, conncting ``middleware``, ``apollo-server-express``, ``graphql``, ``@apollo/client``, and use both querires and mutations to make the server work.

## How it Works 
* All you hae to do is acess this deployed heroku site https://git.heroku.com/mod21-app.git
* Next, just search a book you want to read and if you would like you can create an account
