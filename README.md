# Find a Book
In This Project I connected the ``middleware``, ``apollo-server-express``, ``graphql``, and ``@apollo/client`` using both querires and mutations to make the server work. This was a good challenge for me because I am more proficient in Front-end code but I knew I had the skill set to complete the task need for this project. I felt that it would only help me to have more backend experience under my belt. Feel free to ``git clone`` my repository and checkout the code for yourself!

## How it Works 
* Just acess this deployed heroku site: https://git.heroku.com/mod21-app.git
* Next, search for a book you would like to read. You can aslo create an account if you would like
